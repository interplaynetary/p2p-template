# Proof and Strategy for a Truly Free Association of Free Individuals

We present a formulation of a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the *spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other* without any centralized control, planning, private-property or state intervention!

This requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.).

**In this free association, the share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-fulfillment!** (mutual-recognition of contribution towards each other's self-actualization)

**Surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions, relations activate only through genuine desire and participation, and these properties persist even as relations compose into complex social structures.**

Simple math will reveal how in free association: false recognition/relations naturally decay while true recognition/relations strengthens - that recognition and social-relations organized on the basis of this free association necessarily tend towards social-material-truth.

You can interact with an interface implementing this logic [here](https://interplaynetary.github.io/free-association/) (still in active development).

## Example based Introduction:

Imagine a potluck where pies you bake that you don't need (surplus) helps a neighbor spend less time cooking, *freeing their time* to fix their oven — the same oven that later bakes bread for your community garden party. That’s mutual-fulfillment: Your surplus doesn’t vanish—it flows to those who directly/indirectly align with your needs/desires/values/goals etc. (and vice-versa), *creating a ripple effect of mutual-support that comes back to you in unexpected ways while strengthening the network*. You're participating in a network where every contribution amplifies the collective capacity for everyone's growth.

This approach represents a fundamental shift from traditional charity or market-based systems. Instead of asking "What can I get in return?" or "Who deserves my help?", the question becomes "How can my surplus best contribute to a network that supports everyone's self-actualization?" As this network grows, it creates a new kind of economy - one based on recognition, reciprocity, and the understanding that our individual fulfillment is inextricably linked to the fulfillment of others.

## Proof & Strategy:

**Let:**
- **One's Recognition** = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.)
- **One's Total-Recognition** = 100%

**For any participants A and B:**
1. A can (re)-attribute to B a share of A's total-recognition
2. B can (re)-attribute to A a share of B's total-recognition

**Let:**
- **Mutual-Recognition(A, B)** = min(B-share-of-A's-total-recognition, A-share-of-B's-total-recognition) = Mutual-Contributions towards eachother's self-actualization

**For example:** If you are 50% of my total-recognition, and I am 10% of your total-recognition, our mutual-recognition is 10%, the minimum of the both.

*Taking the minimum of both shares ensures reciprocity in proportion.* 

*Mutual-recognition is the peer-2-peer social-validation of eachother's efforts as well as the social-validation of use-values/utility.*

*Interestingly  we don't have to keep a ledger of objects whose definitions are centrally defined, there is no universal definition of object-hood (of what constitutes objects), but a distributed recognition of the social-utility of contributions!*

*In free-association, one does not value apples (objects) but a contributor's provision of apples (subject-verb-object).*

<details>
  <summary><b><i>More on Subject-Verb-Object</i></b></summary>

  *In free-association, one does not value apples (objects) but a contributor's provision of apples (subject-verb-object).*

  In stark contrast, in commodity production, one values objects (apples) but not the labor that produced them (the subject-verb-object relation).

  Alienated societies, expropriate the product (object) from the producer (subject-verb) and alienate the producer from the product.

  In capitalism, the capitalist claims to own the surplus-product produced by the subject-verb, and can sell it as a commodity, which leads to *commodity fetishism*.

  By exchanging the objects between eachother, (already alienated from their respective subject-verbs) the commodity fetish takes full hold: **and definite social relations between men themselves, take on - for them - the fantastic form of a social relation between things.**
  
  "In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must take flight into the misty realm of religion. There the products of the human brain appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations, both with each other and with the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men's hands. I call this the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour as soon as they are produced as commodities, and is, therefore, inseparable from the production of commodities." - Marx

**Let:**
- **Surplus** = Roles one holds but does not desire

**Definitions:**
- Direct Relation: A ↔ B (A and B directly connected to eachother)
- Transitive Relation: A ↔ B ↔ C (A and B transitively connected to each other via B)

Surplus can be distributed directly/transitively via *Mutual-Recognition Distributions*: **The share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-fulfillment!**

*"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"*

**Surplus Distribution**
- A's share of B's surplus = MR(A, B) / Σ MR(B, X), where X includes all others B recognizes.
- B's share of A's surplus = MR(A, B) / Σ MR(A, X), where X includes all others A recognizes.

More generally:
- Share(Receiver ← Giver) = MR(Receiver, Giver) / Sum(MR(Giver, Other) for all Others Giver Recognizes)

*The distribution of surplus-roles through networks of mutual-contribution is a form of distributed-peer-discovery/offering/matching! Finding collaborators who directly/transitively contribute to your eachother's self-actualization!*

*What one is actually distributing surplus to is one's **direct/transitive mutual-self-actualization***

**Let:**
- **Association** = a set of relations where:
1. Each Relation consists of (Provider-Role, User-Role)
2. Each Role has a Holder who can:
   - Express Desire (Will to Play)
   - Express Playing (Active-Participation)
3. Relations become Active only when:
   - Both Role-Holders express Desire
   - Both Role-Holders express Playing
4. Holders can stop expressing Desire and Playing at any time
5. Relations can be composed into larger structures while maintaining these properties

<details>
  <summary><b><i>Forms of surplus: Why Roles? Beyond Obligations</i></b></summary>

For starters we should clarify that when we speak of distributing surplus (via free-association digital interface) we ARE NOT speaking of distributing physical objects (manually distributing real objects) according to digitially derived mutual-fulfillment distributions. We are distributing digital representations of relations of object/use provisioning.

Various economic-protocols have taken the approach of transferring *rights* to underlying objects/provisionings, where some party has (the perhaps transferable) *obligation* to provision the object.

A lot of civil-society is organized around such *mutually-referencing right-obligation pairs*.

Some examples:
- The right to a loan carries with it the corresponding obligation to repay, the right was obtained by granting the right to seize collateral to the lender and taking on the obligation to comply with any such seizures.
- The right to a court hearing means some judge carries the corresponding obligation to preside over the hearing. 

And these rights/obligations can often be transfered! Debtors regularly trade and transfer the right to collect on debt (seconary repo markets). Similarly the obligation to preside over a hearing may rotate from judge to judge!

To give another example, a reciept for purchasing a coffee represents a right to the drink/food, and the issuer of the reciept has the corresponding obligation to provide the coffee.

And of course these obligations are often enforced by the threat or use of the force of state-intervention.

Instead of mutually-referencing right-obligation pairs, free-association introduces mutually-referencing role-pairs that go beyond the concept of right/obligation.

In contrast with obligations which one must do, regardless of whether one desires, relations in free-association activate only through mutual desire and participation, where either player of the role can stop expressing desire to play at any time - at which point the role counts as *surplus*, that can be distributed through mutual-recognition networks until it arrives at someone who once again desires to play the role!

**Why provider/user?**
Well you could call them whatever you want, giver/reciever, producer/consumer etc. 

However, I am particular drawn to **provider/user** because it is general enough to encapsulate the entirity of production, distribution, and consumption, while avoiding connatations like ownership/private-property/transfer of ownership (potentially implied in the giver/reciever).

For example: One can be *provided* housing, a glass of wine, etc. while this in no way implies the transfer of ownership!

So these role-relations are less about property, rights/obligations and are more about *social-material coordination-potential*

</details>

**Let:**
- **Total Recognition = 100%**
- **Total Recognition = True Recognition + False Recognition**
- **Real Contributors** = Those that actually perform the operations necessary to *transform* social-material reality in concrete-particular ways.

For any participant:
Total Recognition = 100%
Total Recognition = True-Recognition + False-Recognition
   ∴ ↑False-Recognition = ↓True-Recognition
      ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Real-Contributors
         ∴ ↓Real-Surplus from Real-Contributors
            ∴ ↓Real-Relations with Real-Contributors
               ∴ ↓Access to Real-Social-Material-Coordination
                  ∴ ↓Real-Social-Material-Basis for Self-Actualization
                     ∴ Social-Material-Truth is processually realized in Free-Association by processual social-material negation of False-Recognition

*Note: True/False recognition is not binary, nor expressed as a proposition (propositional logic). The question is what % of your recognition feels true/false to you? How true is this? To what degree?*

<details>
  <summary><b><i>Click for Example</i></b></summary>
   
**Consider someone receiving money from a wealthy person:**

**True Recognition Scenario:**
- You need $1000 for rent
- A wealthy person provides you $1000
- You recognize their contribution to your need for money (say 20% of your total recognition)
- This is true recognition because they actually contributed to that specific need

**False Recognition Scenario:**
- You hope to get more money by flattering them
- You claim they've contributed to:
  - Environmental protection (20% recognition)
  - Community wellbeing (20% recognition) 
  - Cultural development (20% recognition)
- But these were actually achieved by other contributors

**Mathematical Impact:**
- Your total recognition must sum to 100%
- By giving 60% false recognition to the wealthy person
- Plus 20% true recognition for money
- Only 20% remains for all real contributors
- Therefore:
  - Real environmental contributors can get max 20% recognition
  - Their mutual recognition with you decreases
  - Their surplus (help) flows less to you
  - Your actual needs get less fulfilled

**Key Insight:**
If you wanted more money legitimately, you could:
1. Honestly adjust your need distribution (e.g. "Money is 40% of my needs")
2. Give appropriate recognition for money received
3. Maintain recognition for other real contributors

This preserves your ability to receive genuine help for all needs while being truthful about what was really contributed.

The mathematics naturally punishes false recognition by reducing your access to real contributions. You can't get more total value by inflating recognition - you only decrease your connection to real contributors.

**For any Relation - a pair of roles played by A and B respectively:**
- Mutual-Desire(A↔B) = Desire(A→B) ∧ Desire(B→A) 
- Mutual-Playing(A↔B) = Mutual-Desire(A↔B) ∧ Playing(A→B) ∧ Playing(B→A)

**Free Association requires:**
1. *Mutual-Recognition* > 0
2. *Mutual-Desire* (both parties genuinely desire the relation)
3. *Mutual-Playing* (both parties actively participate)
4. Access to *Social-Material Coordination* Necessary for *Mutual-Playing*

**For any participant:**
- ↓Real Contributions → ↓Real Mutual-Recognition
- ↓Real Mutual-Recognition → ↓Real Mutual-Desire
- ↓Real Mutual-Desire → ↓Real Mutual-Playing
- ↓Real Mutual-Playing → ↓Free Association
- ↓Free Association → ↓Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Contributors

**On Transitive Self-Actualization:**

Transitive self-actualization refers to the ripple effect of contributions as they spread beyond a single hub of interaction. Rather than an isolated A → B relationship, we see A helping B in a way that not only meets B’s needs but empowers B to help C, D, and so on. This means that *one’s actions to help a neighbor* do not stop once that neighbor’s need is fulfilled; instead, **the neighbor’s newly enhanced capacity** to help others becomes part of the original contributor’s indirect contribution as well. In a free-association framework, these “transitive” contributors seed a chain reaction of material and social support that expands the web of mutual-fulfillment. Again, your surplus doesn’t vanish—it flows to those who directly/indirectly align with your needs/desires/values/goals etc. (and vice-versa), *creating a ripple effect of mutual-support that comes back to you in unexpected ways while strengthening the network*.

When Node A helps Node B, and Node B in turn supports Node C, Node A ends up benefiting from an environment where Node C is stronger or better able to meet Node A’s needs in the future—even though A and C may never interact directly. In terms of self-actualization, fulfilling a single node often unlocks opportunities for fulfilling an entire network, because **every node’s fulfillment contributes to the overall capacity for support.** Thus, transitive contributors demonstrate that *individual well-being is always embedded in collective well-being*.

  <summary><b><i>How this differs from equity</i></b></summary>

  *Equity* structures also operate on the basis of proportions of 100%, the sharehoders hold a share in the company.

   Imagine we are each involved in organizations that issue their own shares and distribute dividends (surplus) to their shareholders.

   Mutual-Stakeholding [(ECSA)](ecsa.io): Imagine several such organization swapping shares with each other, now dividends are flowing bidirectionally through the network.

   We are risking-together and benefiting-together.

   In Mutual-Stakeholding, we have entered a non-zero-sum economic relationship, in which we each gain by increasing the well-being of all others.

   All of these desirable properties of Mutual-Stakeholding are inherited in Free-Association, but with a **crucial** difference.

  In equity you *own* a share of me.

  You may deploy any duplicitous means to gain my recognition of your contribution towards my self-fulfillment, you could lie to me with no end! And so long as you have secured your shares: you *own* my recognition.

  In other words, in Mutual-Stakeholding: the **Past dominates the Present**. I can not remove my recognition of the past that is no longer true, because you own it. 
  
  **The transferability of recognition in the form of objects/tokens/money - is the condition of possibility of the accumulation of recognition in general and is the condition of possibility of false-recognition that persists even in the light of new information in the Present.**

  On the contrary, in Free-Association: **The Present reigns over the Past**. I am able to, at a whim, modify my recognition of the Past in the light of new information in the Present.
  
  In Free-Association I can *re-attribute* shares of my total-recognition - also proportions of 100% - and **this is only possible because in Free-Association we each own 100% of ourselves!**

  *We are free! You don't own me, and I don't own you! We owe each other nothing!*

  Recall that Mutual-Recognition is Hegel's resolution of the master-slave dialectic.

  <summary><b><i>On Capital Relations (and Coercive Relations in General) within Free Association:</i></b></summary>
   
**Let:**
- Capitalist-Simulated-Production = Production appearing to come from capitalist but actually produced by contributors!
- Commodity Fetish = The masking of social-material relations of contribution behind the veil of the product as commodity (market-relations) - the objective social-forgetting of the social-origin of things [(Lotz)](https://christianlotz.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/lotz-fiction-without-fantasy.pdf)
- Second-Order-False-Recognition = False recognition given to obtain capital for buying labor-power

**For any participant C attempting capital accumulation via Second-Order-False-Recognition:**
1. ↑Second-Order-False-Recognition of Capital → ↑ Possibility of Mutual-Recognition with Capital Provider
2. ↑Capital → ↑Ability to Buy Labor-Power
3. ↑Bought Labor-Power + Capitalist expropriation of Product from Producer → ↑Capitalist-Simulated-Production
4. ↑Capitalist-Simulated-Production = ↑Real Products
5. ↑Real Products → ↑Potential for Real Recognition from Others

**However, for Real Contributors (A, B) whose labor-power has been bought by C:**
1. As A, B begin organizing on basis of Free Association:
   - ↑Recognition of mutual dependencies in contribution
   - ↑Recognition of potential direct association (A↔B)
   - ↑Pressure on C participate in contribution and make real-contributions
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - C's need to maintain capitalist claim to ownership of surplus and means of contribution
     - C's need to have contributions recognized by freely associating contributors

2. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Labor-Power Purchased ↝ ↑Potential for that Labor-Power to organize on the basis of Free Association
   - ↑Formation of Direct Contributor Associations
   - ↑Visibility of real contribution dependencies
   - ↓Effectiveness of commodity fetish in masking relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization of bought labor-power via Free Association
- → ↑Internal pressure to reveal real internal contribution relations
- → ↓Internal recognition of Capitalist's claim surplus-contribution/distribution
- → ↑Recognition of direct contributor dependencies
- ∴ Capital relations become increasingly unstable as bought labor-power organizes via Free Association

**In other words:**
The commodity fetish cannot persist when the labor-power being purchased begins organizing on the basis of Free Association, as this creates pressure to reveal real contribution relations. The commodity fetish, which normally masks social relations of contribution, cannot be maintained within Free Association because Free Association requires demonstration of real contribution, creating a contradiction that must resolve either through the loss of recognition of Capitalist-Simulated-Production or its dissolution into Free Association.

  <summary><b><i>On Free Association and State Power:</i></b></summary>

**Let:**
- State-Power = The organized force appearing separate from and above contributors
- State-Mediated Governance = Coordination via state apparatus rather than direct free association
- State-Simulated-Coordination = Coordination appearing to come from state but actually from contributor self-organization
- State Fetish = The masking of real social-coordination behind the veil of state authority - the objective social-forgetting of the self-organizing capacity of contributors
- Property Relations = Legal framework enforcing exclusive control over means of contribution
- Bourgoise Legal Fetish = The masking of class relations behind formal equality before the law

**For any state apparatus S attempting to maintain property relations:**
1. Initial state:
   - State power maintains property relations
   - Property relations restrict common utilization despite dissolution of particular capitalist organization
   - Coordination appears as coming from above
   - Social relations appear as legal relations

2. However, as free association expands:
   - ↑Scale of free association
   - ↑Number of contributors organizing via free association
   - ↑Practical common utilization despite formal property relations
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - Legal property framework
     - Actual contribution relations

3. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Gap between formal ownership and real utilization
   - ↑Material power of associated contributors
   - ↑Self-Coordination of Contributors → ↓Need for State-Mediated-Governance
   - ↑Difficulty of enforcing private-property relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization via Free Association
- → ↑Visibility of real coordination capabilities
- → ↓Recognition of state's claim to necessary coordination role
- → ↑Recognition of contributor self-organization capacity
- ∴ State power becomes increasingly superfluous as contributors organize via Free Association

**In other words:**
The state fetish cannot persist when contributors organize via Free Association, as this demonstrates their real capacity for self-coordination. State power, which normally appears as necessary external force, reveals itself as superfluous when Free Association shows contributors' capacity to coordinate their own social-material contribution.

**Therefore:**
- ∴ State power isn't abolished but withers away as its functions are increasingly rendered unnecessary in Free Association
- ∴ The social-coordination of things replaces the government of persons
- ∴ Free Association realizes both social and material self-governance of contributors

**Therefore**
- ∴ (↑Dissolution of capitalist organization into Free Association ∧ ↓Effectiveness of state power in maintaining private-property relations) → ↓Force of the limits imposed by organizational-forms-based-on-class-division on the utilization of means of contribution in common by Freely Associating Contributors
- ∴ ↑Means of contribution in common → ↑Access to Materials Necessary for Playing Associations
- ∴ ↑Truly Free Association (both socially and materially)

  <summary><b><i>Being Explored: Recognition as Bandwidth?</i></b></summary>

**Recognition as Bandwidth:**
- **Let:** 
- **Total-Receptivity = Total-Recognition = 100%**
- **Default: OtherShareOfTotalReceptivity = shareOfGeneralFulfillment**
    - (each side can have un-reciprocal receptivity)
    - Receptivity-Overrides for special cases should be possible.

For example I would set my **Receptivity-Limit = 1k Charecters/day** and your share of my 1k charecters/day is equal to your share of my total-recognition (shareOfGeneralFulfillment).

Each recognizer can set their their **Receptivity-Limit** on the fly!

So if you are 50% of my total-recognition, you would be allowed to send me 500 characters/day.

If I am 10% of your total-recognition, I would be allowed to send you 100 characters/day.

We could override this default for special cases.

This allows us to take control of our own attention. And in a sense allows people to sets limits on the working-day (or at least to set limits on the amount of attention that they are willing to give to others via free-association interfaces).

**Question:** should default bandwidth-for-other be shareOfGeneralFulfillment or share-of-mutual-fulfillment-distribution?

  <summary><b><i>Being Explored: What if States Freely-Associated?</i></b></summary>

Thus far we have principally spoken of free-association between individuals, but what about between organizations, communities, states etc.?

In the case of states, if they mutually recognized eachother's contributions towards their own self actualization, and surplus flowed bi-directionally, there would be no more need for imports/exports or international-trade because resources and coordinations flows as surplus from mutual-recognized contributors. 

Internally each state/organization would have a mechanism for collective setting of the proportions of the branches of self-actualization of their community. For example: Each citizen has an equal share of proportion-setting-power.

We can also imagine a mechanism by which citizens could delegate a portion of their proportion-setting-power to another agent, within a particular category. So for example delegating 10% of your proportion-setting-power in the category of "environmental protection" to an ecologist.

Such a scenario would have a number of benefits and would make the question of the socialization of land and means of production easier to answer, but raises other questions.

Some of this is being explored in the [resources/leafs.md](resources/leafs.md) file.

Within the constitutions of various states, there are clauses that allow for the conversion of private property to state ownership. Their names vary, but terms like "nationalization" or "expropriation" are used when done on a larger scale (like industries) or "eminent domain" when done for specific properties (like land for highways).

These clauses generally allow governments to take private property for public use, though usually with the requirement to provide "just compensation" to the original owners. The specific terms and scope vary by country:

In the US, it's the "Takings Clause" of the Fifth Amendment
In India, it's covered under Article 31 of the Constitution
In the UK, it's called "compulsory purchase"
In many Latin American countries, it's known as "expropiación"

However it should be noted that socialization of land and means of production in the hands of existing states (often times bourgoise, deformed-workers-states or degenerated-workers-states) comes with a lot of legal and historical baggage, and is not a simple process. 

**Bourgoise State:** the capitalist class has not been overthrown, the economy is largely private and market-driven, and there is no internal democracy or workers' control of industry.
**Deformed Workers State:** the capitalist class has been overthrown, the economy is largely state-owned and planned, but there is no internal democracy or workers' control of industry. In a deformed workers' state, the working class has never held political power like it did in Russia shortly after the Russian Revolution. These states are considered deformed because their political and economic structures have been imposed from the top (or from outside), and because revolutionary working class organizations are crushed. 
**Degenerate Workers State:** the capitalist class has been overthrown, the economy is largely state-owned and planned, there was internal democracy or workers' control of industry, but the working class lost political power, and democratic control of the state has given way to a state controled by a beauracratic clique.

Moreover, the question of how to distribute the means of production and land, if they are to be socialized, is a complex one. So is the question of how to distribute the surplus-production of the means of production and land, if they are to be socialized. And more fundamentaly, what will decide of each of these - the governance of each State - is a complex question.

Rather than reforming existing states, dual-power should be established in each country, and should be established on the basis of the widest democracy.

It should be noted that socialization in free-association will likely take place out of natural necessity on the part of individuals and not necessarily via the use of state-power.

"Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of us would have in *two ways affirmed* himself and the other person. 
- 1) In my *production* I would have objectified my *individuality*, *its specific character*, and therefore enjoyed not only an individual *manifestation of my life* during the activity, but also when looking at the object I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be *objective*, *visible to the senses and hence a power beyond all doubt*. 
- 2) In your enjoyment or use of my product I would have the *direct* enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a *human* need by my work, that is, of having objectified *man's* essential nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another *man's* essential nature. 
- 3) I would have been for you the *mediator* between you and the species, and therefore would become recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion of your own essential nature and as a necessary part of yourself, and consequently would know myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love. 
- 4) In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly *confirmed* and *realised* my true nature, my *human nature*, my *communal nature*.

Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.

This relationship would moreover be reciprocal; what occurs on my side has also to occur on yours." (Marx)

*"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime desire; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"* (Marx)

**When individuals freely contribute to each other's self-actualization, when surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions towards eachother's self-actualization, when relations activate only through mutual desire and participation - then we have finally a form in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all!**

*"Communism as the positive transcendence of private property as human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being – a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man – the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution."* (Marx)

*"Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations."* (Marx)

# What is being done:
- Ruzgar: A p2p interface (a single html file) is being created for peers to express their mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.) and to distribute associations (mutual-relations) according to their mutual-recognition-distributions. Implementing all the logic presented in this proof.
