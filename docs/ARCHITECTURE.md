# RSStream Architecture: Client-Server Responsibility Distribution

This document outlines the fundamental architectural patterns and responsibility distribution in RSStream, abstracting beyond RSS-specific implementation details to reveal the core principles of hybrid P2P-centralized systems.

## Overview

RSStream demonstrates a **hybrid architecture** that combines:
- **P2P distributed database** (Gun/Holster) for real-time data synchronization
- **Minimal centralized server** for operations requiring atomic consistency, external bridging, or trusted authority

This architecture emerges from fundamental constraints in distributed systems and browser security models, not from RSS-specific requirements.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. **Atomic Operations Require Centralization**
Any operation requiring **exactly-once semantics** or **global uniqueness** must be centralized to prevent race conditions and conflicts.

### 2. **Browser Limitations Require Bridging**
Browser security models prevent certain operations, requiring server-side bridges to external systems.

### 3. **Trust Requires Authority**
Establishing initial trust and enforcing system-wide policies requires a trusted authority.

### 4. **Everything Else Should Be P2P**
Any operation not constrained by the above principles should be distributed for resilience, scalability, and censorship resistance.

## Server Responsibilities

The server handles three fundamental categories of operations that **cannot be safely distributed**:

### üîí **Atomic Scarcity Management**

**Pattern**: Operations on resources that must have exactly one state or owner globally.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- Invite code consumption (single-use tokens)
- Username uniqueness enforcement
- Resource quota management (feed limits)
- Account creation (atomic identity establishment)

**Generic Applications**:
- Financial transactions
- Unique identifier allocation
- License key distribution
- Resource reservation systems

**Why Centralized**: P2P systems cannot guarantee atomic operations without expensive consensus mechanisms (blockchain). For most applications, centralized atomic operations are more practical.

```javascript
// Server ensures atomic invite code consumption
const claimInviteCode = async (code, userPubKey) => {
  // Atomic check-and-consume operation
  const invite = await getInviteCode(code)
  if (!invite) throw new Error("Code not found")
  
  await Promise.all([
    createAccount(userPubKey, invite),
    deleteInviteCode(code) // Atomic deletion prevents double-use
  ])
}
```

### üåâ **External System Bridging**

**Pattern**: Operations requiring capabilities that browsers cannot perform due to security restrictions.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- Email services (SMTP access)
- Static file serving (HTTP server)
- Network bootstrap (well-known endpoints)
- External API integration (RSS feed services)

**Generic Applications**:
- Payment processing
- SMS/email notifications
- File system access
- Hardware integration
- Third-party API access

**Why Centralized**: Browser security model prevents direct access to system resources, network services, and many external APIs.

```javascript
// Server bridges email capability gap
const sendValidationEmail = async (email, validationCode) => {
  // Browsers cannot send emails directly
  await emailService.send({
    to: email,
    subject: "Validate your account",
    body: `Your validation code: ${validationCode}`
  })
}
```

### üëë **Trust & Authority Management**

**Pattern**: Operations requiring authoritative decisions or serving as root of trust.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- Administrative functions (system configuration)
- Identity verification authority
- Network trust anchor (host public key)
- Policy enforcement

**Generic Applications**:
- Certificate authorities
- Administrative dashboards
- System configuration
- Access control policies
- Audit logging

**Why Centralized**: Distributed systems need a root of trust and authority for system-wide decisions. While governance can be distributed (DAOs, voting), execution often requires centralized coordination.

```javascript
// Server provides trust anchor for P2P network
const getHostPublicKey = () => {
  // Clients need this key to bootstrap into P2P network
  // Must be served from well-known, trusted location
  return serverIdentity.publicKey
}
```

## Client Responsibilities

Clients handle all operations that can be safely distributed and benefit from P2P architecture:

### üìä **Real-Time Data Synchronization**

**Pattern**: Collaborative data sharing with eventual consistency.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- RSS feed item sharing
- User preference synchronization
- Group membership updates
- Content metadata distribution

**Generic Applications**:
- Collaborative document editing
- Chat messages
- Social media posts
- IoT sensor data
- Gaming state synchronization

**Why P2P**: Real-time collaboration benefits from direct peer connections, reduced latency, and offline resilience.

```javascript
// Clients sync data directly via P2P network
const shareContent = (content) => {
  // Automatically syncs to all connected peers
  user.get("content").put(content)
  
  // Other clients receive updates in real-time
  user.get("content").on(newContent => {
    updateUI(newContent)
  })
}
```

### üîç **Content Discovery & Curation**

**Pattern**: Distributed content aggregation and filtering.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- Feed subscription management
- Content categorization
- Personal feed curation
- Content recommendation

**Generic Applications**:
- Search indexing
- Content recommendation
- Social media feeds
- News aggregation
- Product catalogs

**Why P2P**: Content discovery benefits from diverse perspectives, personalization, and resistance to algorithmic manipulation.

### üíæ **Local Data Management**

**Pattern**: Client-side storage, caching, and offline capabilities.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- Local content caching
- Offline reading capabilities
- User preference storage
- Performance optimization

**Generic Applications**:
- Offline-first applications
- Local data processing
- Performance optimization
- Privacy-preserving storage

**Why P2P**: Local data management provides better performance, privacy, and offline capabilities.

### ü§ù **Peer Coordination**

**Pattern**: Direct peer-to-peer coordination without central authority.

**Examples in RSStream**:
- Content sharing between users
- Distributed content validation
- Peer discovery and connection management
- Load balancing across peers

**Generic Applications**:
- File sharing networks
- Distributed computing
- Mesh networking
- Collaborative workflows

**Why P2P**: Peer coordination eliminates single points of failure and enables direct collaboration.

## Hybrid Architecture Benefits

### **Resilience**
- P2P components continue working even if server is down
- Server handles only critical operations that require centralization
- Graceful degradation of functionality

### **Scalability**
- P2P network scales with number of users
- Server load remains minimal and predictable
- Content distribution happens peer-to-peer

### **Privacy**
- Most data flows directly between peers
- Server only sees minimal identity/coordination data
- Users maintain control over their content

### **Censorship Resistance**
- Content distribution is decentralized
- Server cannot control or filter content
- Multiple entry points to the network

## Design Guidelines

### **When to Centralize**

‚úÖ **Centralize when you need**:
- Atomic operations (exactly-once semantics)
- Global uniqueness guarantees
- External system integration
- Trust establishment
- Administrative control

‚ùå **Don't centralize**:
- Content storage and distribution
- Real-time collaboration
- User-to-user communication
- Personal data management
- Content discovery and curation

### **When to Distribute (P2P)**

‚úÖ **Distribute when you have**:
- Collaborative data sharing
- Real-time synchronization needs
- Content distribution requirements
- Offline-first requirements
- Privacy/censorship concerns

‚ùå **Don't distribute**:
- Operations requiring global consistency
- External service integration
- Administrative functions
- Identity verification
- Resource scarcity management

## Implementation Patterns

### **Server Implementation**
```javascript
// Minimal server focused on atomic operations and bridging
const server = {
  // Atomic operations
  claimResource: atomicOperation,
  allocateQuota: atomicOperation,
  
  // External bridges
  sendEmail: externalBridge,
  serveStaticFiles: externalBridge,
  
  // Trust anchor
  getPublicKey: trustAnchor,
  validateIdentity: trustAnchor
}
```

### **Client Implementation**
```javascript
// Rich client handling P2P operations
const client = {
  // P2P data sync
  syncData: p2pOperation,
  shareContent: p2pOperation,
  
  // Local management
  cacheData: localOperation,
  managePreferences: localOperation,
  
  // Peer coordination
  discoverPeers: p2pOperation,
  coordinateWork: p2pOperation
}
```

## Conclusion

RSStream's architecture demonstrates that **most application logic can and should be distributed**, while only a **minimal core of operations require centralization**. This pattern applies broadly beyond RSS aggregation to any system requiring:

- Real-time collaboration
- Content distribution
- User autonomy
- Censorship resistance
- Scalable architecture

The key insight is recognizing which operations have **fundamental constraints** requiring centralization (atomicity, external bridging, trust) versus those that benefit from **distributed execution** (collaboration, content sharing, personalization).

This hybrid approach provides the benefits of both centralized (consistency, integration) and decentralized (resilience, scalability, privacy) architectures while minimizing the drawbacks of each.
