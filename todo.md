# Readme
[] - Add intro on how this economy is based on gratitude! Recognize, feel, and act!
[] - Add examples
[] - Correspondance Truth : make commodity fetish etc more discreet, focus on subject, verb object correspondence.

# Code in General
[] - Make comprehensive tests!
[] - Make tests for all the edge cases!

# Treemap
[✅] - make text scale to fit
[✅] - descriptions on nodes
[✅] - make contributor instances last node (can't go further down in tree)
[✅] - Make calculations more efficient? using contributor-map?
[✅] - It should be clearly possible to make a node a contributor simply if it doesnt have a parent!
[] - Lets simplify isContributor logic!
[] - Lets simplify getShareOfGeneralContribution logic! And generalize to traversal of any note, default is general.
[] - Allow for distributing surplus to any branch
[] - shareOfGeneralRecognition view: the size of the squares of shareOfGeneralRecognition: is the **potential** mutual-recognition -> and **potential** share of surplus-distribution
[] - create generic treemap for displaying:
    [] - shareOfGeneralFulfillment view: the size of the squares of shareOfGeneralRecognition: the fulfilled is what is recognized as actual!
    [] - One's share of surplus-distribution is based on one's share of one's mutual-self-actualization!

# Node
[] - Are we properly accounting for the share of an instance in a node? (especially when it has multiple types which are contributors) (split the share of that instance between the types)?
[] - Make type-circles on nodes transition more smoothly

# Organizations
[] - Right now the code focuses on mutual-recognition between individuals. We should also allow for mutual-recognition between organizations! [resources/leafs.md](resources/leafs.md)

# P2P
[] - Gun.js user-space
[] - Gun.js add peers
[] - Peers as types!

# Inventory & Associations
[] - add a button to distribute surplus (in general, or to a specific branch/leaf?)
[] - integrate with inventory.html
[] - make inventory.html more user-friendly


# Interface
[] - + Node button (big) (Import sub-treefrom Library)
[] - - Node button (big) (Drop sub-tree into Library)

[] - Make everything more smooth, with less sharp clicks!

[] - Allow for touching multiple nodes at once
[] - Allow for dragging nodes around
[] - Allow for composing nodes (dragging nodes to other nodes)
[] - Allow for changing speed of growth
[] - Allow for changing speed of growth
[] - Menubuttons instead of text for add value
[] - Distribute surplus to any branch
[] - AI Integration!
[] - allow for choosing your own name!
[] - Allow adding multiple types/contributors to nodes
[] - How to unallocate points? (when points = 0, remove node)
[] - How to manually reorder them? (by dragging?)
[] - How do we show mutuality directly in the structure? (Showing max min and overlap? Of colors? Of self and other?)
[] - Add a new intermediary class? For networking / persistence?
[] - Add description to Nodes (and maybe other things?)
[] - node.makeContributor (retroactively) turns type into contributor
[] - Display Descriptions to Nodes if they exist! 
[] - Make contributor have special outline
[] - "Add Contributor" button should reveal tabs: known (including self), add new contributor (reveal QR of self to others)
[] - clicking contributor makes it the new root?
    (so you can see the tree from their perspective)
    (but your perspective is retained (your perspective of their perspective))
